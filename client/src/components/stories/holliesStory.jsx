        On the 7th July 2016, I along with a group of 12 other extremely excited
        Blackpool Sixth Form Students and 2 equally excited tutors set off on a
        journey of a lifetime. After a long and tedious journey we finally
        touched down at Kathmandu Airport around 8pm local time and were greeted
        with flower necklaces from our extremely selfless and smiley tour guide
        who instantly made us all feel welcome. The bus journey from the airport
        was truly eye opening, even in the darkness we could clearly see the
        bright colours of the local food, clothing and the smiles that seemed to
        grace every single local’s face, no matter what situation they were in.

        Our first two days were spent exploring the local area, experiencing the
        culture and gaining and understanding of their religions, traditions and
        their way of life. We first visited Pashupatinath; a Hindu temple on the
        banks of the Bagmati river, dedicated to a manifestation of the God
        Shiva, where we were all blessed by local Sadhus and spoke to the locals
        about their way of life. We then visited Durbar Square where we got a
        real feel for the old city by spending time amongst the beautifully
        adorned buildings of the main square, it was also here that the extent
        of the 2015 earthquake was clearly visible - the bamboo scaffolding and
        crumbling, cracked walls showed just how much more work was needed to
        restore this beautiful country to its former glory. The next day was
        spent exploring two more temples,first Boudnath; the largest Buddhist
        Stupa in Nepal where we wandered around rubbing shoulders with the
        Tibetan Monks and witnessed Hindus and Buddhists worshiping in harmony
        with one another. Secondly, we visited Swayambunath; the infamous monkey
        temple where we climbed 365 steps in the sweltering heat to, as the
        locals believe, reach enlightenment. During our trip we also visited a
        temple named Dakhisnkali, here they still host live sacrifices of
        chickens and goats to the Goddess Kali to appease her - the patience and
        dedication of the people at all these places was truly inspiring to us.

        Monday 11th July was the day that we had all been waiting for, after a
        very early get up and a very bumpy drive we finally arrived at
        Shubhakamana Academy we were greeted by lots of very excited, happy,
        young faces. It became clear very quickly how different this school was
        to any that we’d ever seen. From the tuition fees, along with savings
        plus donations from organisations such as Impact Travel- the company our
        trip was organised through - the head teacher had been able to
        commission a new building to be built in order to accommodate more
        children. This was an incredible achievement that students and staff
        alike were immensely proud of, but what surprised us was the fact that
        this building was where lessons were being taught already and where we
        would be spending most of our time, even though there were live wires
        hanging from the walls and ceilings, metal welding was going on all
        around us, the toilets were not completed, no classroom had electricity
        and there was a single tap providing running water for the whole school
        population. However despite all this, the students were some of the most
        joyful and positive people I have ever met.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were welcomed with open arms by the extremely smiley headteacher who
        repeatedly thanked us for coming to teach his pupils and for the lasting
        effect he knew we would have on the children. Following a welcome
        assembly where we were greeted with cheers and chants from the children
        and presented with Kata Scarfs and tikka blessings, the hard work began,
        we began teaching our lessons. Each teaching pair was sent to a
        different class that ranged from containing pupils aged 6 right up to
        age 18 and each day we each taught 3 different classes. From teaching
        about out of space to Shakespeare, construction to psychology each
        person presented the children with a concept that was way out of their
        syllabus. I had the honour of being able to teach the children basic
        first aid, watching the joy on their faces as they realised that they
        could remember how to put their friend in the recovery position and when
        they found out how they could help their mum if she burnt herself was
        inspiring. The majority of the children will not have the ability to go
        into higher education and will most likely get a labour job at the end
        of the school education, however they all have such incredible dreams
        that they truly believe will come true. When asked what they wanted to
        do when they were older, almost all responded with titles such as a
        Doctor, Scientist, Policeman, Pilot, Fireman, Nurse, with many adding on
        that they wanted to earn enough money to look after their families. One
        twelve year old boy called Manish deeply touched everyone in the group,
        living in a children’s home he had no family and very little
        possessions, yet the wisdom in the words that came out of his mouth
        inspired us all- ‘I want to be a doctor, a fireman, a policeman, I don’t
        know which yet, I just know I want a job that means I can help everyone
        in my country of Nepal.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to our visit we got in contact with the head teacher and some of
        the other staff members to ask what would be the best use for the
        incredible amount of money that we had collectively raised as a group
        through our Christmas Quiz night, individual events such as cake sales
        and coffee mornings as well as extremely generous grants and donations
        from different people and organisations. It was decided that what was
        needed the most was educational equipment such as pens, pencils and
        paper and we were also made aware of the fact that many children were
        unable to complete their full years of schooling due to their families
        inability to pay, it was then decided that the majority of the money
        raised would go to sponsoring a child to ensure that they were able to
        gain a complete education. We had the pleasure of meeting the adorable
        little girl who we have sponsored Akrisha Tharpa whilst we were there,
        the knowledge that because of us this incredible little girl would
        receive a full education filled our hearts with pride.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each day at the school brought new challenges and experiences, from
        attempting to teach classes of extremely hyper seven year olds who spoke
        very little English to meeting the 18 year olds who due to the
        dedication to their studies knew things that in this country would not
        be taught until university. However with each passing hour the
        friendships with the children grew stronger, their love and appreciation
        of their education became more apparent and the mark each of the
        children made on our hearts grew deeper. Our last day at the school was
        bittersweet, each one of us were devastated that our time with the
        children had come to the end but the happiness on the students as well
        as the teachers faces when we presented them with hundreds of crayons,
        pencils, colouring pens and notebooks lit up the whole school and
        ensured we all left with huge smiles on our faces.
      </p>
      <p>
        This trip has taught me many things and opened my eyes to the world
        around me, it has taught me that positivity can ease the effects of
        poverty, that we have so much to be grateful for living in this
        incredibly affluent country and that if a negative situation is dealt
        with with patience and a positive attitude is applied then its effects
        will be felt far less.
