          In March 2018, we were given the amazing opportunity within our
          nursing studies to travel out of areas to experience different nursing
          cultures. We decided to travel to Ghana with worktheworld to
          experience how people who donâ€™t have a system such as the NHS can cope
          with health and social needs for the public. To be able to do this
          experience we had a grant from university, but had to fund the rest of
          the 3 week trip for ourselves. Therefore, we decided to do a sponsored
          bike ride, alongside working extra hours at our part-time job to be
          able to fund this trip. We received many donations from friends and
          family, with the Superintendent Gerry Richardson Memorial Youth Trust
          kindly donating towards our fundraising, which allowed us to get our
          remaining vaccinations and medications that we needed to stay safe in
          Ghana.

          Whilst in Ghana, we stayed in the local town of Takoradi, where we
          spent 2 weeks in the Emergency Department of their regional hospital,
          and then the rest of the time visiting local communities experiencing
          their different ways of offering health care to all age groups. In the
          emergency department we were able to share our knowledge with the
          staff and also learn from themselves about specific illness that they
          see regularly such as malaria. Also, with the majority of cars in
          Ghana not having working seatbelts, and there being no systems in
          place on the roads, road traffic accidents were what brought the most
          patients to the door of the ED.
        </p>

          Whilst visiting the local communities, we visited all ages of people
          whose nearest hospital was many hours away. During this experience we
          were able to learn how they provide community care to people who were
          physically unable to attend the local services, and how they monitor
          them whilst in their own homes. We also spent the morning in the
          community speaking with mothers about CPR and how it can save lives,
          before teaching them how to check if a person has gone into cardiac
          arrest and then how to correctly perform CPR. We spent time in their
          community care centre testing locals for malaria, doing regular health
          and blood pressure checks and providing women with contraception.

          We spent time with new mothers in the maternity unit where we did
          checks of the new born babies to ensure that they were healthy after
          birth. Due to HIV being a widespread virus in Ghana, we also spent
          time with new mothers and mothers-to-be who had HIV, and performed
          regular checks of their health both during and after pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our time in Ghana is something we will always remember, and is
          something that we continue to take with us now that we are qualified
          nurses. It is experiences like this that are eye opening, and make us
          fortunate for the healthcare that we are able to provide in our
          country. But also makes us see how incredible the nurses and health
          care professionals are in Ghana that do their ultimate best to save
          the lives of their patients with the resources and knowledge that they
          have.
